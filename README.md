# DJS05: Show Detail Page with Routing and Navigation


I updated and added files   that:

- Implements dynamic routing for show detail pages.
- Fetches show data from https://podcast-api.netlify.app.
- Shows a detailed show page with seasons and episode accordions.
- Preserves filter/search state by appending query string to the detail links.
- Includes responsive styling and simple accessible controls.
- Contains JSDoc comments in main modules.

## How to run locally

1. Open a terminal in the project folder:
   ```
   cd React-DJS05/React-DJS05
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the URL reported by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173).
